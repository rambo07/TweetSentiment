#ACMilan #ManU 2-3 Wow, what a match. Two team fighting like gladiators in the awesome San Siro stadium.
ManU wins 3-2 but Carrick shown red for Evras tackle ... What is this????
How the fuck do they do it. ManU might be lucky as hell but they have a winning mentality.
#Carrick sent off #Manu down to 10 min FT it's #AcMilan 2-3 #Manu #ChampionsLeague #Football #Brits

Nxa #ACMilan u had 2 go giv #ManU the game. Wat a waste of my sleep.
Way to go #ManU . Killed Madrid.
#ACMilan had chances in the last 5 minutes and stoppage time but #ManU hung on 3-2. Seedorf goal for Milan was Scholes goal, but on purpose!
How did ManU win that, should've been 2 or 3 half time! Last goal Rafael's fault. Poor 2nd booking for Carrick!
@FarOutAkhtar there it is ManU ManU :)

AC was suppose 2 start wit Seedorf, @ziphomdluli said it... But a win is a win... Well done #ManU!

YAY! #ManU #ManUtd won! Lovely game #Rooney .
Seedorf's still got it :) ... as much as it PAINS me to say, that was a great turn 'round by ManU
For all of you soccerheads out there; a report from my better half back home: Rooney has two goals for ManU in match vs Milan.
Good comeback ManU. Wayne Rooney &lt;3
Attention was on ManU and Milan, but I'm much more interested by Lyon beating Real Madrid. I would LOVE to see them knock those fuckers out.
yaaaaaaaay! ManU 3 Milan 2   ::shaking by bootay::
Although ManU wins, Carrick got 2nd yellow on d last minute for kicking d ball away! Unbelievable!
ManU with the win. God job fellas
Manu Milan that is how the game should be played end2end attack  kept you on your toes the whole 90 touches of brilliance under preasure 3-2
@LilMissNYJet gotta remember the away goals count more than home goals.  Now ManU has a points advantage over AC when they play in England
it got dicey there at the end, but #ManU pulls through!
good result for #manutd against acmilan......
ManU 3, Milan 2. I believe it was the Reds' first win at San Siro? Sad day for Motherland.

@greenmind0428 This ManU vs Milan game is pretty fantastic good.
The lackluster season of ManU is only saved by the amazing season of Wayne Rooney, it seems. #ucl
Valencia shows why Nani had to go. Let's hope he keeps on going. Rooney class. #ACMilan not what they were. #ManU.

Sir Alex Ferguson praised his #ManchesterUnited side following their 3-2 victory over #ACMilan but was disappointed to concede late on.
@SoccerNewsFlash miss under stood your question. I believe yes, as long as the team is running on 8 cylinders 2gether, like w/Rooney @ManU
@crystalgirlie I hate the Italian teams lol And I love the Premier League. I really like ManU, but I LOVE Beckham =D
@crystalgirlie So, I was "Go David, Go ManU" LOL
Wayne Rooney felt #ManchesterUnited were good value for their 3-2 victory over #ACMilan at the San Siro.

David Beckham admitted #ACMilan were made to pay for not taking their opportunities following the 3-2 defeat to #ManchesterUnited.
Ouch.  ManU finally gets one they deserve.  1-2 ManU.  (Pity that Rooney is so stinkin' awesome.)
@AroundTheHorn the folks from @SportsCenter need 2 realize dat today's ManU vs AC Milan was actually played in Milan not Manchester
Ronaldinho is tearing it up.  Van der Sar great in goal.  But Rooney just scored!  ManU 2:1 ACMilan so far
AC played a better game and probably deserved to win but class and conditioning were the difference. #manu don't know how to lose
@optajoe i'm a ManU fan, and i want to ask: how many times in the UCL has a team qualified after losing the first leg at home?
Beckham vs ManU. Awesome Champions League action. Rooney's 2 goals beat AC Milan 3-2.
Juz found out that ManU won 3-2 away to AC milan. Overjoyed :)
Ronaldinho and David Beckam on the same team for #ACmilan but too bad they lost..But that's an Ill ass combo..

Didn't think there was anything on tv so watched football with Dad. Forgot that American Idol was on! Liverpool losing was worth it though.
@fmpundit Not denying that matey. Just saying that he didn't actually ruin Liverpool in his time at the club
to hell with going incommunicado, I want to rant about Liverpool. Tonight's the night I finally lost patience with Rafa... anyone else?
Rafa says Torro and Gerro need further assessment on injuries. Terrible night for Liverpool
Bye bye Liverpool, I'd love to say it'd been a pleasure but...
LOL at Liverpool.  So no fa or carling cup, looking likely they'll miss out on top 4. Missing out on the CL could well screw them.

Liverpool falls to Reading, but the Football Karma balances out as KC is a final city for the US bid!!!!
Will Rafa's guarantee of fourth in the PL even save him at the end of the season? I'm not sure. Liverpool have rarely been so average. #fb

@bazmaz We can't blog fast enough to keep up with LFC's problems. I sympathise.
Fortunately, a huge dose of perspective in the past 24hrs has made Liverpool's well deserved woes tasting a whole lot less bitter.
There's something fantastic in a big team like Liverpool flopping in every competition. Roll on Reading (unless its Arsenal next round)
Not really feeling sorry for Liverpool. Dodgy late pen against them? That sounds familiar.  #bcfc

Advice for Liverpool: Get rid of Rafa and those overpaid hacks and buy the entire Reading team for less than we pay Pepe the goal leaker.
RT @smartamatt: First time in 50 years Liverpool and Manchester United have gone out of the FA Cup in the third round.
Surely Liverpool will sack Benitez now lol, he has had more chances at keeping job than Gordon Brown
@MissLJD_ Yes I'm a Man United fan. So Liverpool losing is great and Newcastle won me a lot of money. Going to America in march.
And whats more damning for Liverpool is they were outscored in 2 legs, and lost the tie at home. It wasn't even some lucky performance!
What next for Liverpool. Can it get any worse

Sorry all u liverpool fans, that must have been tough to watch. Ho ho ho!
Rafa knew FA Cup is gonna be d only thing #LFC is playing for, where is Reina? Why sub Gerrard so early? Torres?
just as last night was a great time for CCFC to play Portsmouth (but fluffed it), so this is THE time to play Liverpool...
Heading to bed. Reading have just scored- Liverpool really are poor. Surely rafa must go
Take out Torres and what are Liverpool ? Missing Torres. Take out Gerrard too and they're pretty much vacuum. Go Reading !
I would have bet my bottom dollar on Yossi to score that one... #liverpool
Common Liverpool this is frustraing!!
I was reading, whilst Reading were playing against Liverpool on the TV. Coincidence? No. It's a sign.
@Swannyg66 looks like Liverpool are "doing an Owen Coyle" too
Come on Liverpool !!!!! you can do this.
My fault for not going? For talking about the next round? For giving up on shite ITV coverage? Or LFC's for not doing what they should? Hmmm

My match report is as follows: We sucked and there's no 2 ways about it! #LFC
liverpool and united out of the fa cup might as well put tottenham's name on it now..
who the fuck is this cunt interviewing rafa , has he never conducted an interview before, hopeless  #lfc #liverpoolfc
Liverpool really are sh*t. I wish I had backed Reading at 9/1. At least Rafa rested his first team.. Hmmm..!
If Rafa wasn't so stubborn he would step down #liverpool
Reading send Liverpool crashing out of FA Cup http://bit.ly/78EMlJ
Another tasty morsel to pick from the smorgasbord of shite that Liverpool have served up this season. Depressing.
@gwto Yes, I know. It's just a bit painful tonight. Walk on. #lfc #YNWA
leave him alone, nasty interviewer #liverpool
How about Paulo Madini for LFC now he is even hotter than Jose ;) ps dont just watch footie for the guys they are the only 2 I've ever liked
Liverpool knocked out by Reading! Get rid of Raffa...he's had his chance
RT @ChilliKat: Liverpool fail.
@rickedwards1 PLEEEEASE don't tell me you're a liverpool fan?!
@AdamWoodyatt I didnt know you supported liverpool how come you support them?
If anyone recorded the Liverpool v Reading match this evening can you upload the video of us being played? none of us got to see it!
@theawaystand but liverpool have been very patient with Rafa, and we love him for bringin us the UCL, but we can only judge him today!
Favourite Liverpool quote:  "Lucas is the worst brazilian since Stevie Wonder shaved his wifes bikini line" (via @Mos-sy)
rafa. it was a blatant penner. he kicked him. (hopefully i'll get away without any abuse from Liverpool fans. You'll be back)
Liverpool lose at home to Reading?! I shouldn't laugh but I can't help it! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
RT @whyo: Oh how sucky it is to be a liverpool fan.
kiss my fucking ass liverpool hehehehe xDD liverpool 1 - reading 2 &lt;3
Look how red faced rafa is, he should be embarrassed liverpool are a top 10 side and he's struggling to keep them up there.
My phone is dead and so is Liverpool FC, bye bye FA Cup....
Missed yet another Liverpool game due to a Wednesday night meeting...2010 starts the same as 2009!
Raffa doesn't have much to say. 1 vacuous sentence after another. Q "In which areas can you improve?" A from Raffa "Some of them" #Liverpool
I agree with what someone said on here. If the love of my life beat Liverpool next wednesday, Rafas going.
I wish rafa would not talk after a game if he is going to avoid issues it makes him look more like a fool #lfc #ynwa
Well done Liverpool, you useless douches(!) Jeez!!
Thanks liverpool, you just made my wednesday so much better!
@RaikkonenFans Ahh very true, but then again, liverpool are in debt and got no money, so they cant afford to sack him anyway lol
Glad I'm not a Liverpool fan.

LFC :( where do go next ?
What's most annoying about the liverpool performance is the hype from the players and manager before hand about looking forward to a run...

Liverpool are absolutely shocking.
Watching Liverpool (FC) being questionable. Also, trying to sort out some Business Analysis training.
Liverpool making it tough for ourselves again. Jeez lads snap out of it.
Reading look so dangerous on the counter. McAnuff just can't find Rasiak with the killer pass. #facup #liverpool
Reading playing well. Liverpool ordinary.
Liverpool are taking a long time to score even Newcastle are 1-0 up
Liverpool struggling against Reading lol
Reading are lookin mightly lively against Liverpool. McAnuff is a quality player.

What is happening with this season? #LFC

yes yes yes Liverpool shoots and scores.
GOAL!!!! 1-0 Liverpool! Steven Gerrard goes for goal, and it's deflected past the Reading keeper! ^GS
Deflected goal for Stevie G at the death of the first half. What a relief! #lfc #YNWA #liverpool
How fucking lucky Liverpool?
Liverpool - lucky buggers. What will they do when Gerrard retires?
Liverpool's MO this season (start strong, get frustrated if you don't score, fall apart in second half) is right on schedule at the moment.

ITV's Steve Rider: "Liverpool can complain about the penalty, but not the score." Um, Steve, they can if equalizer was on said penalty.
@MichaelCox Nearly as bad as Hansen a few weeks back slagging off United and saying Liverpool should've beat Arsenal.
Please don't let it be Brian Howard again. C'mon #Liverpool ... #FACup
@Andy_Jonesy Nothing better than Liverpool getting a dose of their own medicine. Surprised ITV weren't on a break when it happened
penalty to Reading! Hahahaha! Bloody hell Liverpool you are having a mare! via @The_Willster
Went to bed thinking Liverpool would win but getting up again to watch them fail.
I don't hate Liverpool, btw. Just think they deserve a better manager than that shit bearded twat.

What a bag of shite from Liverpool, FFFFFFUUUUUU
UN-BE-LIEVABLE scenes. Reading 2-1 up &amp; Liverpool look clueless. This would be a nail in Rafa Benitez's coffin..
Why are #liverpool losing?

Well done Reading. Thats Liverpool and United out...May be our year... #WWFC #WOLVES :-)

Holy crap Liverpool.
Liverpool = bollocks. What a disappointment. My childhood team in tatters.
Wow, Liverpool are out of the FA Cup now too.  Wonder if they'll be a surprise winner this season?  Nah, it'll probably be Chelsea.
Never mind - it'll only cost #Liverpool about 15 million quid to sack Rafa - bet he's glad he signed that 5 year deal last summer

Liverpool all at sea at the back. Another ball from the right finds McAnuff at the back post about 15 yards out but he scuffs his effort.
@jonoyates oh it's fine from you, you support Man Utd, right? completely acceptable. and to be fair, a lot of LFC fans spoil it for us.
So funny! Reading r definitely getting into d FA Cup by that goal! THis is seriously a bad joke. Pathetic! #lfc
#Liverpool on verge of FA Cup defeat to a team that is 21st in the division below. Maxi Rodriguez is thinking "WTF did I get myself into?"
@TestMatchSofa Another tragic day for the city of Liverpool unfolding on ITV right now ....
Oh did i mention I laid Liverpool on betfair when they were 1-0 up! So if the scores remain the same, I'll be a happy man!
Gutted to see Liverpool losing to Reading. Oh wait, no. It's hilarious!

Cant stop laughing... Shane Long grabs a headed goal from close in. #Liverpool 1-2 #Reading.
Reading have scored all 3 goals have we honestly looked like scoring? #liverpool
@radiophilw you news people and your sensationalism :) Reading is a decent side. Better organised than Liverpool.
The rest of the team have 20 mins to prove we're not a two man team. #Liverpool #lfc This doesn't look good.

I always enjoy watching Liverpool lose
If only Man Utd didn't get knocked out already, I would really enjoy laughing at Liverpool's loss today in the FA Cup.
RT @ManUnitedYouth Ah, can always rely on Liverpool to raise the spirits...
Well we never looked like scoring. The goal was a cross that went in off the defender. 2 good chances, but wasted. Not good enough. #LFC
Time #Liverpool fans woke up and smelled the coffee.  They can't blame owners for what's going on on the pitch.  The blame lies with Benitez
@radiophilw and Gerrard and Torres can't last 90 minutes in a game? Without them Liverpool are average at best. Not good enough.

@JSR88 to be fair, that's been the highlight of adull game. Liverpool are not the team they were...
Liverpool need to becareful few close calls at the end
Sat on end of my seat come on Liverpool.
watching Liverpool FC these days is like a war of attrition. **sigh**
McAnuff missed .... WOW cannot believe that. Liverpool holds on to 1-nil lead with 5 minutes+stoppage left in FA cup vs Reading
Liverpool are off the pace at the moment which is giving Reading some hope in the last stages, but we can kill it with that elusive second

Liverpool are riding their luck - Reading really should have put away at least one chance, and probably deserve something out of this
again Reading almost scored #liverpool
actually just yelped at the liverpool - reading game. how did he miss after such a great run?
85 minutes in &amp; simply not good enough AGAIN!! Utter shite #lfc
How #lfc are still in this tie is beyond me!
Just little injuries for Gerrard or Torres or another sign that they've never been allowed to get fit? Liverpool are worse than ever.
We (Liverpool) really need to sort out our defence.
Great game Liverpool v Reading...... Reading deserve a Goal
In the sports cafe in west end watching Liverpool &amp; eating dinner, good vibes!
would love a cool beer whilst watching the liverpool match.
Liverpool 1-0, so lucky they've not scored...http://bit.ly/4KHe0L #lfc #ynwa
Gonna watch last 5 mins of the Liverpool game, then celeb big bro!
On this display Liverpool would struggle in the Championship!!! Lucas??? Kuyt??? Ngog??? I don't think they'd get picked for 5aside!

Less than 5 mins to go plus Fergie time. #facup #liverpool #reading

Liverpool with their best available 11 are struggling against a poor championship team at Anfield. And this is their one hope of glory.
what is going on with aquilani? where is the concentration? #lfc
Liverpool are completely dominating Reading!
Aww gutted for Liverpool.  NOT! wahayy :) well done Reading! Devostated (sp?) that I will miss #everton v Birmingham though :(. !! #COYB !!!

Liverpool out of FA Cup. season is over. We won't even finish in the top 4 (we'll be 6th if lucky!) time for rafa to go. Get the chosen1!
I'm literally ROFL'ing here, Liverpool was beat by Reading! I know, the tiny incident with Leeds. Still, this is bloody hilarious!
race for 4th place in Prem Lge wide open - Liverpool, Aston Villa, Man City, Spurs - even Birmingham? Most competitive for years.

Wow, Reading knocked Liverpool out of the FA Cup. Giant slayers for sure.
Why does the media pretend what is going on at Liverpool is a "crisis"? Not relegation fodder, not going bust. No sympathy.

To my friends who are Liverpool supporters what can i say. I told you at the beginning of the season and its getting worse 1-2 Reading win
Thought Reading would make it tough for Liverpool, but didn't actually think they'd win at Anfield from 1-0 down! Shocker. Rafa must go.

Rafa did well to sign his new 5 year multi-million £ deal in the summer.  can Liverpool afford to sack him? #lfc #football
@liverpool that is the reason I no longer enjoy going to watch Lfc,devoid of ideas and inspiration,rafa has lost the dressing room
@uzogijima SLS would be if I said Reading didn't deserve to win. My concern is the result represents the way Liverpool are being managed
I'm not sure, but I think Liverpool just got knocked out of the FA Cup by a gang of sailors.

any Liverpool fan who defends Rafa Benitez needs to see a doctor
All those LFC fans who laughed at Utd going out easily - right back atcha!!
I cannot remember liverpool being  as consistantly poor as this at any time in the last 45 years

The Liverpool 2009-10 season = Murphy's Law. Let's call the whole thing off and try again in August.
Feel free all you Man U and Liverpool fans to follow the Palace through our FA Cup run... We could do with the revenue! #TheMagicOfTheCup
Funny stuff, I'll be surprised if Rafa doesn't get sacked now, honestly, Liverpool were basically full strength and were well beaten!
Both reds of Liverpool and Man Utd are out of FA Cup come on you Blues

Reading have done it! Both United and now Liverpool have been knocked out in round three of the FA Cup by lower league opposition!
Man Utd AND Liverpool, both out in the third round? Chelsea: it could be you next if you get complacent, please don't mess this gift up!
@ruthy23 Its been a poor season for the blues...but the plight of Liverpool is keeping our spirits up!
Watching Reading dispatch of Liverpool at Anfield reminds me of 1994 when City did the same which got Souness the sack ... same for Benitez?

I'm really sorry, but Rafa has to go now. That was abysmal #LFC
Liverpool needs a manager that will tell them they're shit because they won't win otherwise
Liverpool and United both out of FA Cup. Therefore no chance of either set of fans using it against each other. The cup's ruined everything.

Hang on, let me get this straight. Liverpool are losing 2-1, and were winning 1-0 - through an own goal? #EPIC #FAIL

Liverpool, kill the game, please.
If only Liverpool could find a better cross into the box.
Liverpool appear to have more threat down the flanks second half although Federici is yet to be tested. Can Reading just hang in there?

So far it's my home city of #liverpool that #Runcorn2wembley will visit in the #facup. Can #Reading score and change it?
Liverpool don't deserve their 1-0 lead over Reading. They are playing with a bit of ease now but were very lucky with their goal.
Liverpool playing tonight - oh the Joy! I am so bored :(
Liverpool seem to be back!? Free flowing I tell you!

Nothing better than coming back from a 3-0 win to watch Liverpool going out.

Bad news, Liverpool are NOTHING without Torres and Gerrard... so says the man of the house anyway.
@jim_salveson Oh yes we do!  Oh yes we do!  The Liverpool result has just made my day!
@ellesbellesx you could turn on the tv and watch liverpool lose
The longer Benitez is manager of Liverpool, regardless of whether they pull this off, the more damage to the progress of the club.
Liverpool's players deserve to be booed out the ground after this, they're a disgrace.
Seriously. Come on Liverpool! Hubbys first visit to anfiel in 4yrs, u can't lose!!!
I seem to recall that time when I read how Aquilani said that Liverpool is better without Xabi.
Liverpool only have two players... Would they even finish top-half in the Prem' if Gerrard &amp; Torres left?
Liverpool, dear oh dear. This could be THE result that changes things. Nothing to play for after this?!
7 mins between Liverpool n cup elimination :| Come ON....!!!
Who are these muppets playing for Liverpool? Remember Dalgliesh, Souness, McDermott, Kennedy, Rush,Thompson,Hansen,Lee,Hughes Stars.
@msheldrake probably because Jim Beglin always has been and always will be a secret Liverpool fan. He makes my blood boil that man.
Someone seems to have replaced the entire Liverpool team with 11 syphilitic part-time crab fishermen with deformed big toes.

Desperate, desperate Liverpool. Useless. Utterly depressing.

Liverpool knocked out of FA Cup by Reading.  Mind you Leeds knocked us out of the Cup so I don't have too much to say.
Deflated. Another one of those nights for Liverpool, and probably another trophyless season.
Is that the final straw as far as Rafa is concerned? Out the FA Cup and Champions League at the first stage, not good enough for Liverpool.
Liverpool 1 - 2 Reading. Result!

Haaaaaaaa Liverpool!!!!!!!! Noooo trophys for you!!!! Got to support Reading my local team lol plus I'm a man u fan!!!! Hahaha
Well done Reading. Liverpool still has its fine sense of humour and a replica of The Cavern, so all is not lost.
Well, there goes the season. How long is this going to carry on? #Liverpool
@Byrnesangel lol,i dont support them but i hate liverpool with a passion,lol.xx
Achh i wanted to see penalties :-( why are liverpool so shit now lol.

RT @kickette: Holy moly, Liverpool. -- My thoughts exactly #LFC
@ChuBoi lol u see liverpool lose to reading tho?
#Liverpool well done Reading. Watching that match you'd be forgiven for mistaking which of the two teams were in the Premiership
@worldofhiglet @MarkusHunt I did write it with a capital letter you know :P Not been watching the football? Reading 2 Liverpool 1 :)
@jamiehex oh I'm loving Liverpool out...and if Torres and Gerrard are really injured...night
All over Liverpool 1 Reading 2 Another triumph for Phil Dowd
liverpool are out loooool #failure
Hahahaha LIverpool!! The shame ha
Well done Reading! Absolutely tremendous. Liverpool really need to get rid of that bad bearded bloke and pronto.
Benitez bought every single player in this Liverpool squad except Gerrard and Carragher
That's it. Liverpool are out of the FA Cup. Another chance at silverware
Love it, tonights football was excellent, Toon win and Liverpool lose, sometimes things can't get any better
RT @CFC8Scott Goodbye United [✔], Goodbye Liverpool [✔]! Whos next? :P #FACup
u make a little boy in the stands cried. shit u, LFC!
Goodbye benitez, Liverpool now might gain a eufa cup place and... Nothing else!
This Liverpool fan is tired of others  supporting Rafa. He's making bad decisions. The players don't want to play for him anymore.He Must Go
I dont even know what to say bout Liverpool atm.
Why oh why did #hcafc have to play Liverpool on the one occasion they've been on fire this season?!
@tozol and with a small squad as it is that shit, would you take 18th now? but could be worse, could be liverpool XD
We've been knocked out of three cup competitions now by mid-January. Not exactly the "treble" I had in mind. Awful. #Liverpool #LFC
Rafa defintely needs to stay on as Liverpool manager, Everton will be the best team in the city in a couple of years.
Reading beats Liverpool in the FA cup something round. We'll be up all night celebrating, of course.
Liverpool- oh dear oh dear
Far out #Liverpool. This is beginning to get sad.
liverpool out of the fa cup
Who said the magic of The F.A. Cup is dead! Man Utd and Liverpool out in the first round, haha!
What happened? Switched off when Liverpool scored. No trophies at Anfield this season. Although losing to late goals is in this year.
RT @championsonfox: Liverpool's season gets worse as they lose in FA Cup's 3rd round by Reading, 2-1. First time out this early since 1959.
Liverpool beaten by Reading at home!
@LibertineGirl My mum, your mum and your big fat auntie played for Liverpool tonight.
Lol I only just realised it was at Anfield too! Fuck's sake, Liverpool are really shit this year. And they still beat us 4-0.
RT @MervinMartin: What's the score&lt;2-1 READING LIVERPOOL R OUT! Hahahaha!
Benitez - time to say goodbye as Liverpool crash out the FA Cup. Is it Chelsea's year again!!
Liverpool 1 Reading 2. Reds crash out of FA Cup. Go now Benitez.
Snow,shit footy from Liverpool,cold,misery...England my England
Okay. That was the last nail in the coffin for Benitez in my eyes. Get a new manager, give him time to build a team for next season #LFC
NOT GOOD ENOUGH we're in January and all LIVERPOOL FC have left to go for is 4th place forget the UEFA CUP not interested
Liverpool lost at home to reading 2-1 shocking result!! Going to bed sensation number one, welcome to new followers:))
Horrendous performance by Liverpool - surely that's it for the waiter now....back to the Tapas Bar Rafa !
@SarahLollipop Tell me sbout it! It's not the same Liverpool anymore =/
Liverpool lose to Reading, not happy but we deserved to lose. Somethings got to change, and soon!
That's alright United and Liverpool out of the way already  =)
...FT and Liverpool are out of the bloody FA Cup... just... argh!
oooh dear Liverpool join Man U, dumped out of the FA cup
Peep! Peep! Peep! #Liverpool have been dumped out of the FA Cup in their own manor by a team that's 21st in the Championship. Sack him Hicks
Could Liverpool win Prem now? 12 points is still catchable and theyve no other distractions They can field Reserves in Europa
Although I'm not a Liverpool fan, I think it is best for the club owners to sack the manager before the situation becomes so much worse.
Haha - Liverpool have lost at home to Reading in the cup. Brilliant
Liverpool out of the cup ... a good game, a slightly soft penalty but over the two legs I feel Reading deserved it.... http://bit.ly/8XlB47
Man utd and Liverpool both fall in the third round, ha.
Any Reading fans on Twitter? Congrats.The X'mas Liverpool Mug that my son(a gooner) gave me, is the only cup we will this season!!!
Wonder what the excuses from Liverpool will be this time?
Oh dear Liverpool. Oh dear

Liverpool Football Club, I love you dearly, but today words fail me...

Nice. Reading knock out Liverpool at Anfield!
Liverpool fc do make me laugh
who'd be a liverpool fan ay?!
Liverpool outta the FA Cup. Might aswell call it a day for Rafa.
Liverpool w/o Torres Gerrard go from 1-0 up to lose 1-2 to Reading! That only leaves the Europa league,lol funny season :) #liverpool #fail
oh dear liverpool...... but newcastle are through, woot woot! west brom next.
Less than half of that Liverpool team deserve to wear the red shirt.  And it's more or less the best eleven, save for Gerrard, Torres, Reina
Turning into another grea t week for liverpool- from f!ck face to reading,thnx for the entertainment!
Liverpool break my heart again. Fuck the FA Cup. Fuck this season. Fuck football. Gutted.
@sportycarrie Mark Hughes for Liverpool? Just a thought.
Man Utd lose at home to a Third Division side; Liverpool to a Second Division one? Is football broken? I hope so; I love it :)
Would anyone mind awfully if I do a LOL at Liverpool?
Exam tomorrow, but celebrating Liverpool getting comprehensively outplayed by a fantastic Reading side. Blue Army!

Well done Reading! Haha Liverpool - good to see the odd wee shock now and again in the cup!
Liverpool won't sack Rafa after this. They'll wait 'til Spurs beat them at Anfield next week. #COYS
Can Liverpool get any worse this season? No doubt the Yanks will take the blame rather than Rafa....
Think fans should be calling Rafa Benitez to go - bring in Jose Mouriniho - Liverpool FC

I'd love to say Liverpool, you're shit, and you know you are. But I won't.
There it is! Scousers fall to Reading 2-1. Adios Rafa! #liverpool
Oh Liverpool. You could almost feel sorry for them. Almost.
HA SCREW YOU LIVERPOOL!!
Liverpool = shit
this'll piss off some people, but I suspect Liverpool got as much as they deserved there
loves a good old cupset (yes thats a word!). Liverpool and Man U gone, its wide open now. To be fair Reading were the better side today.
Liverpool lost to Reading!!! Sorry all you liverpool fans but, WAHOO!!!! NICE 1 READING!!!!!!!!
Just watched Reading dump Liverpool out of the FA Cup. Haha Liverpool!
Liverpool go out of the FA Cup after a defeat by Reading! No Man Utd in the fourth round either. Chelsea's name is on the trophy now surely!
RT @mazlaws Can i be the first one to say Reading Lesson. Liverpool have been schooled.
Well done Reading - Liverpool 1 Reading 2!!!!
@ThomasRichards2 you see the liverpool score?
Well done Reading. Well played.They thoroughly deserved their victory, better team over both games.Liverpool in MAJOR crisis #lfc #liverpool
ah well. looks like my 2.5 hour meeting with my liverpool-supporting boss could be fun tomorrow
FT 2-1!!!!! LIverpool are OUT
We deserved that win....Liverpool were AWFUL!!!!!! GO READING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well done Reading. We were crapola. You deserved it. That's my good deed for the day. Now to stick pins in liverpool dolls....
"Royals win at Anfield!" Now, lets see some of that form in the league, Reading. Liverpool, let's use this as a wakeup for the league!

Liverpool's been knocked outa the FA Cup *SHOCKING*
End of game. Liverpool 1 Reading 2 after extra time. Will rafa be in trouble?
Surely the final whistle on Rafa's Liverpool career. That new bloke must be wondering what he's let himself in for.
an absolutely rotten season gets more rotten #Liverpool #FACup
Im starting to think that watching Liverpool lose has been more fun than watching Chelsea win this season. Well done Reading.
Oh dear!! Poor old Liverpool! Nice one Reading! :)
holy crap,Liverpool are out of the FA Cup,well done Reading
Is that a misprint or are Reading and Liverpool in the 120th minute?
Ohhh my God Reading beat Liverpool at Anfield
Sweet mother of God, Liverpool FC is a mess
Hahaha! Is it bad I laughed at the Liverpool keeper crying?
Down with Liverpool!!!!
awesome Reading beat Liverpool!
Oh no Liverpool are out of the FA Cup! Season over! lol
Liverpool have been beaten by Reading. I only tweet this as my iPhone always wants to change reading to Reading. Only time I'll ever let it!
Surely Liverpool fans you should have kept your slabbering until AFTER your side reached the 4th Round? Egg on faces :)
#liverpool , we lost.. 2-1 damn it.. keep your heads up mate, YNWA
so... no fa- and no carling cup, no premier league title... europe league the last chance COME ON YOU REDS, COME ON LIVERPOOL
RT @dajbelshaw: LOL @ Liverpool - no titles for the Scousers this season! :-D :-D *HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA*
While I spent 90 productive minutes on the trainer, it looks like Liverpool spent the same time pouring their season down the drain. #facup
double wow Reading beat Liverpool..LOL
Reading win to pile more misery on Liverpool.  heh heh heh
Where does that result leave Liverpool now?  Only the Europa League to play for now. Could tonight spell the end for Benitez?
The lowest ebb in 35 years of supporting Liverpool. Disgraceful. Sorry to tweet so negatively but hard to see a positive in what I have seen
Liverpool football crisis - out of FACup to Reading. not good - not good at all :(
Since 1959 Rafa ... since 1959 ... If I was manger of the Liverpool I would be doing the going....
Oh my, Reading put out Liverpool!
Ha ha Liverpool, no chance of anything again this year.
lmfao #liverpool. well done #reading
Pathetic football Liverpool :(
doesnt really matter to Liverpool tho, luckily for them they held their end of season party with their christmas party
Well played Reading, the better team won on the night #lfc
Double fuck with knobs on :( RT @paul_tomkins: Low point of horrible season. Note to self: fuck #lfc
3rd time out of 6 that a championship side has kicked Liverpool out of the FA Cup...FACK MEHN SHET

Liverpool Out, Rags Out! Looking good for the Blues! @MCFC
RT @cloco: The view of a crying Liverpool kid sums it all...
@MosherAngel I am no expert but lots of that Liverpool team look like they couldn't care less
Reading beat Liverpool 2-1. And they postponed the match against Spurs, haha.
Reading leading by 2 goals to 1. Come on Liverpool! We must win the FA Cup!
...which probably makes him Liverpool's best player!? ha
Liverpool football team, your an absolute dissapointment!
Liverpool will probably score from the look of things
My son, who should be asleep is sad Liverpool are loosing against Reading. #liverpoolfc
watching the #liverpool match, prem teams shldn't underestimate lower leagues #coys
ive given up now, Rafa needs to go #liverpool
Why was I the only person at the table to have two different wines from the same glass? You can take the boy out of Liverpool ...
Hubby's swearing at the telly a lot. Liverpool not doing very well.
Dangerous times for Reading, 7 minutes to go Liverpool starting to move forward at every opportunity.
RT @johal20: SACKED IN THE MORNING, YOU'RE GETTING SACKED IN THE MORNING... RAFA BENITEZ #Liverpool
What's going on, liverpool fc?
liverpool need ngog to cheat like he did against Birmingham.
@EvaRut08 hmmm, well Liverpool have been given a lot of..."interesting" penalties in the past lol
One unhappy chappy here atm. my wee boy .#lfc .
@nintendo_fii they aren't even playing xD can't we just join in unison in hating Liverpool? :P
Reading are beating Liverpool at the moment, Brian Laws becomes Burnley manager, what else funny can happen in football today #hcafc
@radiophilw no I'm a Liverpool fan. Point is: hardly a 'massive' upset when two teams are matched. Reading deserve this.
@HotSpurLucy Still love that he's scored as many league goals for Spurs as he has for Liverpool!!! 3 each!
RT @johal20: LIVERPOOL FANS - WHERE'S YOU'RE FAMOUS, WHERE S YOU'RE FAMOUS, WHERE'S FAMOUS ATMOSPHERE?
@timlovejoy sooner or later your luck runs out, Liverpool have relied on it for far too long. Proof they are a 2 man team. Brilliant.
Hates reading and liverpool, hmm I'll go for the underdogs.
@CharrMaxwell oh yeah :) are you from liverpool?xx
@ManMaun it is hard to have some belief in a club which loses from such miniscule opposition, this isnt easy to swallow, YNWA #liverpool
yey Liverpool is trending. I don't care if it's football related, at least I can recognise it unlike most of the other things up there
The #liverpool crisis almost gives me a bon*r
#liverpool kuyt should've done better then
They are killing streams of the Liverpool match faster than I can find them... grrrr,
Can someone DT me with the final score once Liverpool loses?
Liverpool players r fuck ups!
What the fuck is wrong with #liverpool?! Seriously!!?! #lfc #ynwa
Even if it goes to penalties do you feel confident?? Cos I don't! #Liverpool
Even if it goes to penalties do you feel confident?? Cos I don't! #Liverpool
#nowplaying #liverpool vs #reading and its disgraceful that we have lost a 1-0 advantage
Benitez could be collecting his P45 in about 10 minutes.  #liverpool #FACup
@rlop01 this might jinx Reading, but lfc haven't a clue at the minute
every girl i ever kissed i wasn't thinking of a liverpool footballer...
Lol. RT @shortstuffmusic: Oh liverpool... It just gets worse
What a turf season Liverpool are having! It's pure comedy.
@carocat They're embarrassing Liverpool!
Liverpool all the way - not the end yet - remember istanbul
Liverpool are clueless #coys
If David Ngog and Lucas are Premiership footballers then I'm prime minister. Liverpool never been this bad - even when we had Julian Dicks
Out of the Carling, FA and champions league! What now for LFC? Something needs to be changed drastically!
Hahaha - liverpool are looking sooo shit against inferior opposition. Story of their season. RAFA OUT! RAFA OUT! RAFA OUT!
@wellhungman lol im from manchester but live in the south west now, i kno liverpool well tho :)
@liverpool no one on the pitch capable of scoring a goal this is terrible

CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN! #Liverpool
Come on Liverpool!!!! What is going on?
#Liverpool lose a football match of relative unimportance; 50,000 people die in #haiti. I know which I care more about. For today at least.
Rafa not looking as bothered as he should be. This is turning into a disastrous season for Liverpool.
I &lt;3 LFC. But right now our lads are making me cry.
All the Liverpool fans I follow have gone silent... Have we all started burning our scarves yet or what?
@newellhj yes exactly! I wanna see the Liverpool players at the end of the game ;D
5 mins to go. #facup #liverpool #reading
Hahaa..liverpool desperate for the equaliser, not the winner. They beggin for pens. Your doin well reading...
is laughing hard at Liverpool. HAHAHA.
5 mins to go Reading 2 Liverpool 1
@riggwelter he hasn't shown me anything that makes me think he could ever be a #lfc great. Ngog is, imho, top Championship player at best
Is watching the Liverpool match and texting my mate andy, the agreement is liverpool are not as good as they use to be And gerrard is sold
Rafa's face is getting blotchier by the second! Things must be bad... #Liverpool #Reading
I've resorted to prayer #LFC. Seems the only hope left.
@collinslateshow am a Liverpool fan livin in Manchester! Work is gonna be hell tomorrow!
Liverpool's end of season dinner will take place next week...The Menu is confirmed as follows:
#Liverpool don't deserve 2 win anything this year, hopefully its a reality check tht they have 2 bring it next season and sack Rafa !
To quote Winston Churchill, "Liverpool are fucked!"
From the Guardian: "ET23: "What Liverpool fans would give for a Tic-Tacs advert now," writes Peter Green." - HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Liverpool are shocking
O dear Liverpool not looking good... Hahaha
Liverpool without torres and gerrard is like Xmas without santa claus maybe benitez cud do that job next he can rest the reindeers 364 days
@ColdHearted19 why r u supporting the other team isnt liverpool the famous one?
Laughing Liverpool fans, chatting to mates is not what we want to see from the crowd on the telly, they should be screaming their hearts out
Come on Reading, just keep the ball and don't let Liverpool play
@okatieplease All I will say is that Liverpool were clearly the better team for 90 minutes!
Liverpool losing 2 - 1 to reading. Fantastic stuff. Benitez has to go http://myloc.me/2Rmfp
(If) Liverpool loose, is Rafa's job becoming untenible?
Will Liverpool  bring the fighting spirit in for the last 5 minutes

I honestly think that most of the criticism towards Liverpool is not about there poor performance, but Rafa's goatee. Sort it out man!
Liverpool out of the Champions League, the FA Cup(?), the Carling Cup and blatantly (if not mathematically) out of the title race!? Awesome!

Just a terrible, terrible 'performance by Liverpool. Aquilani was not worth the wait. Rafa must be running out of time - def out of ideas.
2 mins for Liverpool to save themselves.

And i thought #rovers where bad, #liverpool are in meltdown. Benitez must be mental if he is thinking top 4 finish
Oh well, we've still got the Europa league! &lt;sigh&gt; #lfc
What's worse about Liverpool's current state against Reading is that the score is 2-1... and Reading's scored ALL THREE GOALS... #lfc

Key for Man City is to try and prevent Fletcher and Carrick pulling the strings in midfield. #carlingcup #mancity #manutd #mufc #mcfc
Predictions tonight? #manutd
4-5-1 with Rooney alone at foward. Things like that drive me insane #mufc

Classy City fans as always, NOT #manutd
city are up 2-1!!! fitting it should be tevez with a brace... just wish i could at least listen to it... :( #mcfc
It looks as if Evra has been hit with a lighter thrown from the crowd. Not what we want to see. #carlingcup #manutd #mancity #mufc #mcfc
lighter hits evra...10 minutes later he ducks.... fast reflexes sunshhhhhine#mcfc
Evra struck by flying cigarette lighter. Not cool. #mcfc #mufc

There's a banner at Utd that says "33 yrs since City won a trophy" and WE are supposed to be the bitter ones???!!! #mancity
Think I just spotted my brother in the crowd hurling abuse #ManCity
#mcfc 34 years since they won something, and so it goes on and on and on......
Could someone calculate how many chewing gums #SrAlexFerguson has consumed in his carreer? :D #manu #mancity #tevez #manchesterderby
Tevez goes for his hatrick from about 22 yards but he was off balance as he shot and it's way over. #carlingcup #mancity #manutd #mufc #mcfc
Oh Tevez you Godsend!! Come on @mcfc
Man. Shitty 2 x 1 #mufc. #shit C'mon United!!!

Not a pen but that makes it sweeter. Only chance of the game though. #mcfc
No celebration? Fuck you Tevez #manutd
Holey moley! Tevez sure can smack 'em! #carlingcup #mcfc
TEVVVVVEEEEEEEEEZZZZZZZZZZZZZ woohoo!! #mancity
Rubbish! Man City score! And Tevez too. Boo- surely that was outside if area! #mufc #roseTintedGlasses
Back even!!! #mcfc
I feel like beating the crap out of this referee. And might I add, this is the only way they could ever score: with a penalty. #mufc
What a penalty!!! BANG... Straight down the middle #ManCity @MissNataliePike
Never a pen. Raphael is brainless, mind. #manutd
This 4-5-1 is sometimes f**king good..enough to give you so much possession on the ball #mufc #manshitty
I'm on Manutd tonight...!! Hate former owner of manshitty.. Corrupted my country to put money on that scums
Was it a penalty? It looked as if the tug may have been outside the area. #carlingcup #manutd #mancity #mufc #mcfc
YESSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLLLL for Tevez!! #mcfc
Tevez accuses Evans of diving. How disappointing #mufc
RT @MikeNE3: Mike Dean that was never a penalty you biased fuck...absolute disgrace. #mcfc cheat their way back into the match!!
Stupid blind bloody referee! Read the sodding rule book - you're only supposed to give a penalty for fouls in the box! #manutd

Mike Dean is a wanker! Talking about wankers, so is Tevez. #mufc
Yo, Man Shitters, we'll meet again on the 27th. Payback time. And this Mike Dean prick better not be the referee again. #mufc
Should have been a draw but Citeh had to cheat for the penalty.Lets see how Felony Bellamy does when Vida is there next time around #manutd

It was a good game spoilt by a bad ref. #MANUTD #MUFC

Bag of shite RT @MUFCNews: ManUtd: City 2 United 1: Reds dominated for large periods but were sunk by two Tevez goals. http://bit.ly/8b2GZe
#manutd I mean, do we really give a shit about Tevez? They have to come to OT with Vidic and Ferdinand back possibly...2-0 at OT easy street
http://twitpic.com/yugdu - At the ground. Atmosphere is cracking #mcfc
I think manutd is currently the biggest flop..Sir Alex made a gr8 mistake 2 sell Tevez n CR9..this is the worst utd team in decades.

Tevez was always going to give his all. He always does. In the right place for a poorly defended corner for his second but a penalty?? #mufc
Some might say, we will find a brighter day! #mcfc
So glad Mancity won(Y), Brilliant performance by CarlosTevez(L) x @MCFC
ManCity 2-1 Man Utd (Final Score).Oooooohhhh.Tidakkkkkk.. :(
RT @wrightjd Tevez played like he had a massive point to prove tonight. Half time, thankfully. #manutd

Just got home, gonna watch it all again, well wouldn't you #mcfc
#Tevez a motivated man for #ManCity! #ManUtd falls in the first leg of the #CarlingCup by a score of 2-1. Brace for Tevez vs his old club.
CLOUD 9! Managed to watch the entire second half on the sly at work and I'm now a nervous wreck! Great spirit and Tevez was fantastic! #mcfc
Sweating, shaking, heart pumping nineteen-to-the-dozen...and it's only half-time! Come on, City! #mcfc
RT @UnitedsRedArmy: Penalty my fucking ass it was a free kick yes man city 1-1 man utd #mufc #manutd
#Carling Cup: schön 1:1 durch ein Elfer von Teves, #ManCity
#football Come on ref that was not a penalty no way #manutd
Tevez is such a cunt. You won't see Beckham celebrating like that when he scores against us! #manutd
OMG!! WTF!!! Absolutely disgraceful decision, never a penalty. #manutd
yes it was fortuitous lawro. Ahh well, plenty of time left #manutd #mancity
Well that was idiotic shirt pulling, but still... Bugger.  #manutd
#ManCity 1-1 #ManUtd; City score through a dubious penalty
#ManCity 1-1 #ManUtd; City score through a dubious penalty
#mancity get a similar pen decision that  #Everton got on Saturday.  All evens itself out in the end doesn't it.  Game on now!
#ManCity 1-1 #Manutd Tevez penalty.foul was outside the box.
Give them hope... they won´t win! We are MANCHESTER UNITED!!! #manutd #mufc
@mattjware Fairplay, misunderstood! #MCFC
This 4-5-1 is f**king good sometimes..enough to give you so much possession on the ball #mufc #manshitty
Bellamy is a cheating scumbag... He will get his someday. #manutd
Come on MCFC make my night... Calm down bellamy
So it's safe to say that ManCity got the ref on their payroll AND Tevez is still sour that ManU let him go
Lawro ; 'City definetly 2nd best...' quite right. #mufc
Still it's silly to tug someone that close to the area and ask the ref the question.  #carlingcup #manutd #mancity #mufc #mcfc
Dear Tevez, Please go and celebrate like that on the train tracks. Sincerely, #Mufc Fans.
YYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!! And fuck off Rooney too with your sly back chat to Tevez. We saw you! #mcfc
Gxddamn Rafael...really? How much older is Bellamy? And now of course the #tevez goal! 1-1! #manunited #fb
Well, if you're gonna be that crap, you need luck like that!! #mancity
manure are losing it #ctid #mcfc
@mcfc My mum said a pray and it worked.
Fuming. But hey 1all half way thru. It's a derby. You wanna good game #manutd
@JohnyMS  that wasn't a penalty. FUCK OFF CITY #mufc
Nice one Bellamy. Get into those cunts! #mcfc

@goodseo ferguson is gonna get a fine after this game. just you wait. he is going to blast the ref a new one #mufc
Fergie doesn't look happy, let the chewing commence. #carlingcup #manutd #mancity #mufc #mcfc
You've GOT to be kidding me! Penalty?! #mufc
Ooohh Tevez displays some cuntishness with his celebration. Think Dean got it wrong. No foul commited in box #mancity
I second that  RT @TicklerTweets I really hate Tevez.  Never a penalty. #mufc
Ha ha! Payback for all uniteds dodgy decisions!!!RT @johnkatcrittall: Where's your blue shirt referee? Scandalous decision! #mufc
Thats two Bellamys I currently love then :P #muse #mancity
Awesome power penalty! Once a much loved #Tevez. He went from unwanted at United to indispensable for #mancity. What a player he was for us!
Uff. Silly penalty to give away. #MUFC
Why isnt mike dean givin that cunt Bellamy a card #manutd #mufc
#ManC #ManUtd game gets a bit rough
Turning point in the balance of shift of power? What's the #BBC commantator on? How many leagues have Shitty won exactly? #mufc

It's heating up now. Bellamy has attracted the ref's attention twice in the past couple of mins. #carlingcup #manutd #mancity #mufc #mcfc
fortunately had to leave game for 15 mins. back just in time for penalty. here we go..#mcfc
@avaricedevil It was outside the box, wasn't it?! #mufc
ok #manUTD, explain to this fan, where does the dislike for bellamy come from ?
Goal. Man shitty. =( 1 - 1  #mufc #manutd UNITED!!!
Bellamy not carded..? Really..? Com'on... Fucking hack! #mufc
shaping upto be a bit of a cracker, come on city! #mcfc #mufc
OK, now i really hate Bellamy, 1st cheat 4 pen, now 2 dangerous tackles, still no card, Mike Dean you should be ashamed too #manutd
Ok now when a KID half the size flails his arms and a tattooed giant HOOLIGAN falls over in the box. Is it still a penalty ? #manutd
Bellamy foul again... Where is a book?  #Mancity #Manutd
I wonder if we'll see yet another Bellamy sending off today? #mufc #manutd
Did Rooney say "watch that post"? His mouthing off made that goal even sweeter.  Bellars needs to calm down #MCFC
Carlos Tevez is going to be to Man City what Eric Cantona was to Man United... #Football #ManUtd #Tevez #ManCity #ManchesterDerby #hashtags.
dat penalty shudnt hav bin wun.. Fuk sakeeee.. #manu #mancity .. Its owk we'v gt da AWAY goal i spose..*
Dirty cheating council house bastards!! Mike dean is wearing a shitty blue shirt under his refs one fecking scouser!!! #MUFC
wasn't a penalty #mancity #manutd
shouldn't have been a penalty that. poor rafael. #mufc
MCFC is flying to the ball now, just how Everton treated us
How many times will Bellamy get away with it? #mufc
RT @ManUtdMEN: Live - City v United http://bit.ly/8H39pK #mcfc #manutd
I might beat the crap out of that Bellamy dude, too. What a prick! #mufc
The Man City fans are proving my earlier point about #mcfc having all the money and none of the class...blatant simulation from Bellamy!!!!!
Evra, officially let you break your friendship with Carlos #mufc
Why hasn't anyone broken anyones legs, or been sent off, or been arrested! Rubbish!!! #mancity #manchesterderby
Into first half stoppage time. #carlingcup #manutd #mancity #mufc #mcfc
I wonder if Robinho watches Tevez's energy and passion or Bellamy's and understands any of it... Enjoy your seat Robby you earned it #MCFC
Are #BBC bias for #ManUtd or what
shaping upto be a bit of a cracker, come on city! #mcfc #mufc
#ManUtd #ManCity #Penalty: We learn... Sheiks have enough money to pay refs.
Half time City 1-1 Utd #mufc #manutd
Typical cheating scum, penalty completely undeserved. How has Bellamy got away with that?!  #manutd #mufc
Great half! #mufc #mcfc
I know mancity are the richest club in the world. I wonder how much they've paid mike dean tonight. What a disgrace. #leaguecup

Can't take it! ManU lost to city rivals ManCity! Tevez was super special. He made ManU pay for selling him.
Wrong result, but if United play this way next week, there's nothing to be worried about! City defended to save their lives-AT HOME! #mufc
Right, we just need to destroy city at Old Trafford then. Easy. O.o  #manutd
Rooney was absolute quality today. Outstanding. #ManUtd

Maybe not the greatest footballing spectacle but it's intriguing none the less. #carlingcup #manutd #mancity #mufc #mcfc
@goodseo if we don't win this then i dunno. we are totally owning midfield. #mufc
Got no fingernails left and it's only half bloody time. #MCFC
1st half. FUCK OFF, CITY! #mufc
What a disgraceful decision for the penalty. Shocking #manutd
HT! Shitty 1 - 1 #MUFC Absolute HATE Citeh!
City don't deserve to be level at the half. But they are, and that's football. #carlingcup #manutd #mancity #mcfc #mufc
RT @NickyButt: ryan giggs is a stud. here is the youtube video to prove it: http://bit.ly/4XpyrH #mcfc #mufc carling cup
good game so far, bit of spice and some controversy. Scouse ref - ha ha. #Football #ManUtd #carling cup
Wtf is going on with my team #ManUtd???!!
anyone watching the mancity match?
#manutd that was never a penalty. Should've been a free kick. We are the better team.
It's one all at half time. Giggs for United and Carlos Tevez from a penalty. Very tense!
Stupid referee. Wasn't a penalty. Didn't touch him in the box. Why hasn't Bellamy been carded atleast once too? Gotta do more in 2nd #manutd
Never really liked Tevez. His face reminds me that of a monkey. #mufc.
HT City 1 Man United 1...mike dean proves himself to be a wanker...tevez a little poodle bitch who'll strip for money #manutd #mufc
Quite a game at Eastlands. You can't say Tevez lacks passion. Time for a cheeky Dolce Gusto. #Football #ManUtd #ManCity
@freshstudios He is a twat, but he's right about the fact the penalty decision was wrong! #mcfc

One thing for sure, there will be a nice fat cheque heading over 2 the FA, signed Sir Alex, after that diabolical penalty #manutd

Ha ha loving the Utd outrage at the ref decision..not even going to mention the 7minutes of extra time last game..oh wait, yes I am #mancity
tevez with a dubious penalty to make it 1-1. I'll take it  #mcfc
@NickyButt Absolutely...Bellamy should have been booked for simulation. #carlingcup #manutd #mancity #mcfc #mufc
Half-time. 1-1. Disappointed that Tevez didn't a) do his dance) or b) do the Adebayor. #mcfc #mancity
have the bbc pundits been watching a different game to me? city haven't really been in the game at all! wouldn't say it's been 50/50. #mufc
getting to be a dirty game but I expect nothing less from a derby.. even if it is a carling cup match. go #manutd!
Well Mike Dean has had a crap half, wasn't a pen and Bellamy should of been booked twice. Its 12 men against 11. #manutd #mancity
United can def this game, but the citizens can still upset us, so careful #mufc, #manutd
@DanSpring We need more Rooney this 2nd half..will be crucial to get a win.. And a bit more from Fletcher.. #mufc
Tevez definitely uglier than he is talented but scores from a dodge penalty  #mufc #manchesterunited #manutd
RT @JimmyTruce: Tevez is such a cunt. You won't see Beckham celebrating like that when he scores against us! #manutd

yea... 1-1 at half... and my computer is about to shatter against the wall... &gt;:( #mcfc
half-time #ManCity 1-1 #ManUtd, Carlos Tevez thumps penalty home after Bellamy was brought down by Rafael. Giggs had opened the scoring
now Tevez dun be a baby boy now. man united didn't sign u cos ur not good enough for united. come on manutd!

Come on @MCFC!!! You can do it!!!!
ManUtd 1 - ManCity 1. Start of the 2nd half. Giggs scored ManUtd's crucial away goal. Tevez scored on a PK.
Playing on phone while he watches ManCity n ManU play football (soccer),if score's tied n stays a draw at end, whats the point? wasted time!
Anyone seen first half of #citeh vs #manutd?  Was 1-1 a fair reflection of the 1st half?

Man City have the lead that gives them every chance when they go to Old Trafford for the 2nd leg. #carlingcup #manutd #mancity #mufc #mcfc
2-1 city. key away goal though. should finish it off at OT. vidic or rio should be back then too. #mufc
First leg 2-1 City. Still all to play for #ManUtd. Second leg in eight days at Old Trafford.
Don't know about you, but I thought the Man Utd A team played very well against the Man City B team! Good game Bobby the Manc. @mcfc
After 5 mins extra time, mcfc squeeze out 2 1 win. Not sure where all that time came from?
